Recently I decided to come back to everquest and was surprised to see that [allakhazam](http://everquest.allakhazam.com/), [Magelo](https://eq.magelo.com/), and [EQ Traders](http://www.eqtraders.com/) were still active and some what helpful. My issue was the all of them have become very profit based. I am having issues with finding information that I need for spells and locations. I was getting very frustrated. After talking with a friend he mentioned pantheon. I will be moving over to pantheon as well, but our major issue is these sites seem to have very long load times or lack necessary information. I am not going to say that this site will be all inclusive. I designing it with progression servers in mind. I will also accept critiques and updates to critical information via email. Yes there will be a donations link if you like the site and want to reward me for my work that would be kind. It is not necessary but will always be appreciated. I will start with spells, then work my way into bestiary. This is not an easy task.
